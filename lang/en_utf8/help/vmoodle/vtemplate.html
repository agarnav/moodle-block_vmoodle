<h2>Virtual Moodle Array</h2>
<p><b>Vmoodle Template</b></p>

<p>When a VMoodle host is instantiated, the contextual part of the
host can be initialized with a predefined data model and an already
constituted exploiation files set.</p>
<p>This loading put in service a VMoodle host, in a preconfigurated
state.</p>
<p>With this parameter, you can choose one of the available
configuration.</p>
<p>The preset instances should be formed with 2 directories :</p>
<ul>
	<li>The first directory contains two SQL scripts called :
	"moodle_master.&lt;base&gt;.sql" and
	"moodle_setup_template.&lt;base&gt;.sql". &lt;base&gt; can be "MySQL"
	or "PostgreSQL" typed, depending on the choosen template's model. The
	first script loads the database with a typed data model, coming from
	the host model of the template. The second script execute
	contextualised SQL request, using some specific parameters coming from
	the instance definition form.</li>
	<li>The second directory contains a preformed "moodledata"
	directory copy. This directory can contain any set of files, coming
	from the host model of the template.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to correct all absolute paths registered by the host
model, the template ask the presence of an additional 'manifest' file,
indicating web and system files roots of the host model. This indication
allows the deployment algorithm to correct any absolute paths of the new
instance.</p>
