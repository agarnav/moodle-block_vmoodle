<h2>Virtual Moodle array</h2>
<p><b>Cron table</b></p>

<p>In order to put in service the new virtual host, a cron
task must be defined for activating cleaning up and asynchronous
upgrades functions.</p>
<p>This field gives you the actual cron table value. You must add
programmation of a new appropriated task to this instance.</p>
<p>Warning, defining virtual hosts on several servers, or on a
cluster system, needs a particular configuration.</p>
