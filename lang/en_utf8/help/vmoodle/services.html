<h2>Virtual Moodle array</h2>
<p><b>Services strategy</b></p>

<p>This field allows services strategy definition, when defining a
virtual host.</p>

<p>It is possible to base the strategy on a default strategy, calked
on the master virtual host's services and defined by an administrator.
This option is automatically selected when the virtual host enables MNET
without selecting a subnetwork, or when the virtual host disables MNET.</p>

<p>In a case of establishing a link with a subnetwork, services will
be synchronized with one actual member of the subnetwork. It is
necessary to remember that all members of a subnetwork are synchronized
in terms of services.</p>
