<h2>Virtual Moodle Array</h2>
<p><b>Physical File System for the Instance</b></p>

<p>Any user file will be uploaded within a single data volume
usually called "moodledata". This field allows defining the location for
this file volume. Usually, it will be preset using the vmoodle block
global configuration parameter physical prefix, and the shortname of the
moodle virtual instance.</p>
<p>The physical file repository is loaded with a set of preexisting
files obtained from the "Virtual Moodle Template" definition.
<p>Warning : you should ensure that the root path of all virtual
instances are writable by the master server.</p>
<p>The physical repository location CANNOT BE UPDATED after the
instance is created.</p>
