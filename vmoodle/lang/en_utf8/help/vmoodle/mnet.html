<h2>Virtual Moodle Array</h2>
<p><b>MNET Activation of the Instance</b></p>

<p>New virtual hosts can be integrated directly in the MNET master
network. For this, the master must be itself in the MNET network. If
this is not the case, the instance installation continue, but its
network settings will not be configurated.</p>
<p>It can be possible to mix instances with and without the network.
By default, all the instances activating the MNET network will be in the
same MNET network.</p>
